        caption: 'An interactive slider map depicting <span class="legendDot ruralGage"></span> non-urban to <span class="legendDot urbanGage"></span> urban shift in stream gage location between 1967 and 2018 in the state of Colorado.',
        paragraphText1: "Data sharing in the early eras of streamgaging was often cumbersome. Field visits were required to collect readings and data were shared once yearly in a published report. These data sharing methods met the challenges of the day, as accessing streamflow data from printed reports supported the engineering of flood-control structures and hydropower assessments, but new innovation was required to meet the needs of more urgent water decisions.",
        paragraphText2: "In the 1980â€™s, most gage data transfer was moved to satellite transmissions, making the data much more easily accessible on a near real-time basis. By 1995, the USGS launched National Water Information System web delivery (NWISweb), which published data to the internet and made it publicly available. Now, data can be accessed shortly after being captured by sensors, making near real-time streamflow monitoring possible. These advances opened up entirely new possibilities for emergency flood prediction and management. ",
