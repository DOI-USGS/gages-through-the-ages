        paragraphText: "In 1995, the USGS launched National Water Information System web delivery (<a href='https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis' target='_blank'>NWISWeb</a>), which published data to the internet as it was collected. Today, NWISWeb provides public access to historical streamflow as well as many new types of water information that can be visualized or downloaded shortly after being measured in the stream by sensors, making near real-time water monitoring possible. These advances in data delivery opened up entirely new possibilities for emergency flood prediction and management."
