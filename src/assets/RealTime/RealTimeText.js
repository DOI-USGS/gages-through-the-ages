        title: "Technological Advances Making Real-Time Monitoring Possible ",
        introText: "",
        paragraphText1: "Data sharing in the early eras of streamgaging was often cumbersome. In-person field visits were required to collect readings, and data were shared once a year in a single published report. These data sharing methods met the needs of the day, as accessing streamflow data from printed reports supported the engineering of flood-control structures and hydropower assessments, but innovation was required to meet the challenges of more time-sensitive water decisions like flood warning.",
        paragraphText2: "In the 1980s, most gage-data transfer transitioned to satellite transmissions from the streamgage to USGS computers, making the data much more easily accessible. By 1995, the USGS launched National Water Information System web delivery (NWISWeb), which published data to the internet and made it readily available to the public as it was collected. Today, data can be accessed shortly after being measured in the stream by sensors, making near real-time streamflow monitoring possible. These advances in data delivery opened up entirely new possibilities for emergency flood prediction and management.",
