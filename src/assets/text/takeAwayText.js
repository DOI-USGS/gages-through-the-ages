            {paragraphText1: 'In 2019, the USGS established a new initiative called the <a href="https://www.usgs.gov/mission-areas/water-resources/science/usgs-next-generation-water-observing-system-ngwos" target="_blank">Next-Generation Water Observing System (NGWOS)</a> to provide high-resolution, state-of-the-art, real-time data on water quantity, quality, and use necessary to support 21st century water prediction and assessments while also serving as an incubator for new instrumentation and innovative methods of monitoring water resources. The USGS plans to implement NGWOS in at least 10 watersheds with diverse environmental settings that can serve to represent larger regions across the Nation. Data from these intensively monitored watersheds will be used (alongside data from existing monitoring networks) to help develop advanced models to fill in data and knowledge gaps that limit water prediction and assessments in those watersheds that can be extended to support predictions/assessments at a National scale. This advanced observing system will provide quantitative information on streamflow, evapotranspiration, snowpack, soil moisture, a broad suite of water quality constituents, connections between groundwater and surface water, and water use. These monitoring upgrades are designed to meet the increasingly complex water challenges facing communities across the Nation.'
