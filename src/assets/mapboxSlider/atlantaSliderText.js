Notice in the map above how evenly dispersed the 1967 gages are along waterways in the Rocky Mountains."

            {paragraphText: "As the creation of new dams slowed significantly after the 1960’s, some hydropower-oriented gages were no longer essential.  As those gages were retired, they weren’t replaced. But as population centers like Denver, Colorado Springs, and Fort Collins urbanized, new gages were built there, as reflected the new small clusters of gages found near those cities in 2018."
