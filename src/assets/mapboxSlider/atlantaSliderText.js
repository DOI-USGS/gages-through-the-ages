            {aboveSliderText: "Early USGS streamgages were distributed widely across the landscape, while an increasing fraction of newer gages have been concentrated in urban areas. A combination of urban growth, evolving local needs, and advances in monitoring technology have resulted in a shift of the proportion of urban gages in the U.S. A conservative estimate suggests in 1967, 16% of gages would have been considered urban (see methods details), compared to the 23% of USGS gages located within urban areas in 2018. For example, in the metro area of Atlanta, Georgia, where population increased five-fold between 1967 and 2018, major increases in urban gages (see orange dots in the map below) were motivated by the need to better plan for floods and droughtsâ€”as well as new regulatory demands and the complex litigation of water uses between Atlanta and downstream communities."
