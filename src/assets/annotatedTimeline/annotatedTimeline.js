        title: "A Brief History of USGS Streamgaging ",
        introText: "",
        firstParagraphText: 'USGS streamgaging began in 1889 with the establishment of the first gage on the Rio Grande in Embudo, New Mexico, where the first team of hydrographers were being trained in new techniques to <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3034/pdf/fs2014-3034.pdf" target="_blank">measure water flow systematically</a>. The Embudo gage marked the beginning of an era where streamgaging was used to assess the potential of the Nation’s water resources to support growth in the western U.S. Better understanding the amount of water for hydropower and irrigation in the West guided much of the monitoring by the USGS in the early 1900s, leading to the earliest period of growth in gages—a slow accumulation of monitoring sites that resulted nearly 200 active gages by the turn of the century. By 1930, the hydropower and irrigation needs began to plateau while the need to expand flood control capacity was on the rise. ',

            {paragraphText: 'The period of 1930 to 1960 was marked by infrastructure investments in response to major floods. New dams and release structures were engineered to better protect life and property from future floods, but they required a detailed understanding of the expected ranges of river flows, which the USGS could provide. In 1929, Congress established the USGS Cooperative Program which supported federal cost sharing with state and local agencies, resulting in a new source of funding that generated the largest sustained growth during the history of US streamgaging.  This type of funding continues to the present day. The cost-sharing partnerships between the USGS and state and local agencies has enabled the Nation to better tackle the increasingly complex and intertwined local- to national-scale water issues.'

            {paragraphText: 'After 1960, monitoring priorities began to focus on water management and environmental regulations.  Many of these priorities have grown and declined (such as the coal hydrology studies of the 1970’s), which led to variations in the national streamgage count. The number of streamgages declined from 1991-1996 due to factors including stringent national budget cuts, but funding from Congress was established to retain federal priority streamgages beginning in 2004. The need for advanced flood warning has driven much of the growth in gages during recent years.'
