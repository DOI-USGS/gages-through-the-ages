        introText: "",
        firstParagraphText: '<br><br>USGS streamgaging began in 1889 with the establishment of the first gage on the Rio Grande in Embudo, New Mexico, where the first team of hydrographers were being trained in new techniques to <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2014/3034/pdf/fs2014-3034.pdf" target="_blank">measure water flow systematically</a>. Over time, the growth and decline of streamgages across the United States mirrors the ebb and flow of hydrological programs as priorities shift, science advances, and funding is allocated. Today, the USGS streamgaging network extend across all 50 states and Puerto Rico to provide real-time data delivery, putting the Nation at the forefront of water monitoring in the 21st century.'
