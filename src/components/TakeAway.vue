          USGS responds to the present-day needs of water management and the protection of life and property. 
          As factors change that influence where water measurements are needed, USGS continues to adapt. A new 
          initiative established in 2019, called the “Next-Gen Water Observing System” is piloting new advanced 
          water monitoring in the Delaware River Basin and will be expanding into the Upper Colorado River Basin 
          next year. These new sources of water information will inform water resources decisions and help advance 
          the understanding of how best to meet the nation’s water needs.​
